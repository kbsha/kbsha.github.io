  <h1>page with css and Html</h1>
<P>CSS is used to style the elements in a web page.<br>
  CSS is a styling language that works together with HTML to give a page its look and layout.</P>
  <p>CSS builds on top of HTML. <br>The style attribute allows you to use CSS properties to customize the visual presentation of HTML elements.</p>
  <p>CSS properties control the style of HTML elements.<br> Examples of CSS properties are color, border, font-size and margin.</p>
  <p>CSS properties and values are separated with a colon :</p>
  <p>The CSS code for an HTML element must be enclosed in double or single quotes, following the style attribute.</p>
  <h3>⭐CSS is used to style web pages<br>
    ⭐ CSS is one of the three core web technologies<br>    
    ⭐ The style attribute adds CSS to HTML tags    
    </h3>
    <p>When CSS code is added to HTML elements, this is called inline CSS.

      <h3 style="color:gray">Thise is the text</h3>
      <p>css styling technique ... </p>
      <li>inline css</li>
      <li>internal css</li>
      <li>external css</li>
      <p>The styling technique that adds CSS code inside HTML elements is called…inline css</p>
      <p>An alternative styling technique is internal CSS. Internal CSS is used to style the entire page.<br> The <u>style</u> container tag is added within the HTML document to group all the CSS code for the page.</p>
      <p>The selector in the CSS code matches the HTML tags you want to target.</p>
      <p>Separate multiple selectors with a comma to apply the same style to different elements. This makes your CSS code simpler.      </p>
      <p>It's best practice to include all the internal CSS code in the <head> of the page.      </p>
        <h3>CSS controls all the design-related aspects of your web page. This includes fonts, sizes, colors, position, spacing, layout, animations, and much more.</h3>
        <p>CSS code creates styling rules. <br>The simplest styling rule consists of a selector, plus a declaration in curly braces {}.</p>
        <style>
          h2 {
            color: brown;
            font-size: large;
          }
        </style>
        <h2>styling rule selector and declaration</h2>
        <p>A declaration consists of two parts: a property and a value.        </p>
        <p>⭐ CSS code is made of styling rules<br>
          ⭐ A rule is made of a selector and a set of declarations<br> 
          ⭐ A declaration consists of a property:value pair          </p>
          <p>Styling rules for parent elements will also be applied to child elements by default. This is known as inheritance.<br> Child elements inherit styles from their parents.          </p>
          <style>
            h1{
              color: red;
              font-size: large;
              background-color: yellow;
            }

          </style>

          </h2>
          <p>For total control over the design of your HTML elements, you can give them IDs and classes.</p>
          <p>The id attribute is used to identify unique elements in an HTML document.          </p>
          <p>You can target specific elements using hashtag # followed by the ID name as a selector.</p>
          <style>
            #id1{
              color: blue;
            }
          </style>
          <h2 id="id1">
            css use id attrbuit to unique elements
          </h2>
          <p>Another way to identify elements is the class attribute. Use the class attribute to give the same identifier to a group of elements</p>
          <p>class is the attribute that you’d use to apply the same style to a group of elements </p>
          <p> You can create styling rules for a group of elements in the same class (group).<br>
            Use a dot . followed by the class name to target all the elements in the same class. </p>
            <style>
              .cl1{
                color: green;
              }
            </style>
            <h2 class="cl1">
              css use class for gropu of elements to manifast same style 
            </h2>
            <p class="cl1">thise text is on the same class as the above !</p>
            <p>You can give the same class name to…Class but not id </p>
            <p>A style rule for a class will be applied to all the elements in that class.</p>
            <p>You can also target only those elements of a specific type that have a certain class.<br>
              This CSS rule will modify only paragraphs with the content class.</p>

              <h4 class="demo">Test </h4>
              <p class="demo">Test </p>
              <button class="demo">Test</button>
              <p>⭐ The ID selector uses the hash # symbol and targets a specific element<br>
                ⭐ A class gives a common identifier to a group of elements<br>
                ⭐ The class selector uses a dot . and targets a group of elements with the same class</p>
